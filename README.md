## Introduction 
This repository contains code examples to show you how to call the Amadeus for Developers Self-Service APIs.

The examples are written in the following languages: Node, Java, Python, Swift and cURL.

## Dependencies

The Node, Java, Python, Swift require the installation of library and languages versions as described in the documentation of our libraries.
